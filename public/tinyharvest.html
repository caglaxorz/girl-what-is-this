    <p>oh my god. i can't believe someone actually played this up until level 17. if anyone actually sees this, let me know. it might seriously change my career trajectory. i have always wanted one of these three things: a) becoming a published novelist, b) creating my own kid's animation series, and c) creating my own game, like stardew valley. the one i was the farthest away from has always been c. but now my redbull-fueled 3am extravaganza turned into this random game and someone actually played it so much that they're at level 17! you know there is no option to save right? that required coding knowledge i didn't have. seriously though, let me know if you're reading this, and i'll learn firebase for you. &lt;3</p>
